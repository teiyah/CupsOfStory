                            Let me tell you a story about Mr. Eeky-Weeky and his uncanny ability to make things out of fuzz.
                            <br><br>
                            He was a small thing, that Mr. Eeky-Weeky, yet charming as can be. A little push is all it took for Mr. Eeky-Weeky to rise above his humdrum job to his multi-billion business named Fuzz It All.
                            <br><br>
                            Let's go back a little though, to a place where he once needed. A place real small, where he was born, not that tall, but he called it home.
                            <br><br>
                            "Fresh baked cookies and a coffee pot, the smell of fresh croissants. Not quite a breakfast of champions, but close enough", he thought.
                            <br><br>
                            On one sunny day, as breakfast came and went, he thought "I think the day's too clear!" He jumped up high, with a half impressed smile, then sat back down to think. "I think, I think" but nothing came. He thought again, "I
                            think, I think," and still the same. His brain a door that wouldn't open, even for the best of his mindful voices.
                            <br><br>
                            Another day would come and go until 100 days later, he finally spoke:
                            <br><br>
                            "A day too clear needs a fuzzy reinvention, an unconventional decor. It needs the sound of fuzz to ring soundtracks at passersbys, playing music at romantic restaurants. It needs curly dresses that twirl beneath the seams
                            at the hips, fuzzy love on the skins of those who wear it.
                            <br><br>
                            It needs an oil painting across the river created by a master, capturing the fuzzy houses in the reflection of the water as the photos taken of the passing cars capture forever the insanity of speed with a fuzz-like
                            exposure."
                            <br><br>
                            A fuzzy idea. Not very polished, but enough, he thought, to make a leash for puppy Olie he loved too much for words to... "Ah, I lost it."
                            <br><br>
                            He leaned down to find the wind was blowing from underneath the table he was hard at working. And there he saw it, a pile of fuzz from little Olie, whose time for shedding was prime in its glory.
                            <br><br>
                            And there it started and there it went. A leash, a collar, and soon a dress, for fuzz had no limits to address.
                            He worked and worked on laces, and hats, and on many things until, at last, he tailored a beautiful coat that made its way to runways, fashionistas, and headlines. Mr. Eeky-Weeky became a sensation overnight, and he soon
                            became the fashion icon of Milan; the world cheered at all his creations, and only the rich could afford his chic.
                            <br><br>
                            His world did change like he had wanted and the clear days in the sun finally ended up fuzzy.

                            I have a cry wolf taped shut in a shoe box under the fridge. It likes to be in a cooler environment so it can complain about it.
                            <br><br>
                            I often times wonder if I should throw it out, but the thought of separation gives me anxiety. It has me where it wants me.
                            <br><br>
                            Sometimes it screams and scares the neighbours. Other times, it sits in silence, unnoticed. I often times wonder if I should call for help when it gets angry, but it quickly calms itself into remission.
                            <br><br>
                            It's been a challenge living under the same roof together. I am not one for sudden loud noises; they make my heart skip an unhealthy number of beats. Not knowing when or why it might have an episode puts me on permanent
                            emotional standby.
                            <br><br>
                            We've lived together for years. I don't remember my life without it, although on occasion some flashes of my past resurface at the most inconvenient times. I shut them out altogether. It can sense when I'm reminiscing, and
                            I try not to draw unnecessary attention.
                            <br><br>
                            My friends keep asking if there is anything they can do to help, but that question really bores me. Courtesy mannerisms are pointless. One might as well keep to their own business instead of draining the little life I have
                            left with such shit.
                            <br><br>
                            The box got broken into last night. The clues say my rat infestation might have finally got the best of us. My cables also took quite a hit, so watching television might require some additional effort. It sucks, too,
                            because I was really getting into this show.
                            <br><br>
                            I now have a rat in a cage on my fridge, with a cry wolf in its belly.

                            I watch him standing there screwing it in with this look of complexity. I’m laying on my back in bed, my hair hanging off the side, soaking in the water I spilled on the floor while trying to cure my hangover.
                            <br><br>
                            The dog is asleep beside me, probably dreaming about last night and the champagne he licked off the floor after the countdown.
                            <br><br>
                            New Year’s Eve has always been a complicated rollercoaster of emotions, mostly pertaining to the accomplishments the year helped me achieve.
                            <br><br>
                            This year however, felt like more of a collective feeling, as if the world stood still, taking in the last breath that 2020 had to offer amongst all the disasters it had already put us through. All waiting for the
                            countdown to end, so we can begin into what some might see as a fresh start.
                            <br><br>
                            We are now in 2021. It feels like electing a new president that will either continue destroying its country, or slowly mend it again through drips and bandages. No one knows, and we all wait for the screw to either hold it
                            all in or break.
                            <br><br>
                            I keep watching him work as my dog snores away the last drop of that 2020 champagne.

                            It was this time of year that the pot was boiling on my stove with a raspberry smell and a hint of chocolate. I wanted to believe it was done so I could taste it, but it seems a watched pot really never finishes. Neither
                            did I that night.
                            <br><br>
                            It was a perfect. I got everything ready, I was prepared. An unfair life, but a fool consumed by obsession is just that, a fool. You stepped through my door like the perfect statue you were, an unfortunately emotionless
                            specimen with perfect muscles. I felt lucky, a fox in her prime easily catching prey she can play with for a while. A fun thought, a sad reality.
                            <br><br>
                            I was barely able to serve you the drink I so carefully made. Your clothes were already being ripped to the floor with such an unfortunate desire. Two should have played your game that night.
                            <br><br>
                            Your lips were a stale, cracked imagination of the Sahara Desert, lonely, confused, and so tastelessly bare. My clothes still on while you stood there so vulnerably naked didn't give me the power I desired. It just made
                            you look weak.
                            <br><br>
                            The man in my room I had wanted to fuck was now not intriguing enough to me to be fun. It was a strange realization that your beautifully carved body was never going to be enough to make a woman satisfied.
                            <br><br>
                            You tried. A kiss on the neck, a nibble on the ear. All the typical things one would do on a first date. Not quite my thing. Like the dripping water from a fountain I was not.
                            <br><br>
                            When you left, I sat waiting for a chance to shake the strangeness I felt when you touched me, a distanced feeling from a man too near for me to bare. Let me be clearer, I hated everything you were and all you continue to
                            represent.
                            <br><br>
                            And yet I continue to masturbate to your memory.

                            I am terrified of dying. So much so, anything related to death puts me in a lump sum of legs and arms shoved in a corner facing just enough wall to feel safe. I hate it.
                            <br><br>
                            It all started when my aunt died in her sleep due to a brain aneurysm. Wrapping my head around the thought that you can kiss someone goodnight, never to wake up to them again is close to… "Um, no”.
                            <br><br>
                            The fear is probably a useless one, especially because I can't control death. And yet, I find myself in tears picturing when death will come. We go through life thinking it's the enemy that ends all, takes away the you,
                            leaves behind the remains you have no control of, and smirks at the hope that your family might have actually read the letter attached to your will and scattered you over Mount Kilimanjaro like you've always dreamed of. We
                            reconcile with it through preparations: life insurances, wills, savings accounts, hoping to leave behind a safe haven for our loved ones.
                            <br><br>
                            Somewhere in this cluster of vast fear and precaution, I have forgotten I am currently very much alive - locked up in my house so that others can also have a fighting chance at life. There’s a sense of unity with the world
                            as I sit here trying to remember what my friends used to look like.
                            <br><br>
                            I think it must be a life lesson of some sort.
                            <br><br>
                            Even when I do get in touch with friends, I have a hard time catching them up. It’s like a ping pong game of “How are yous?” and “What's news?”, both sides feeling a lack of conversation that used to be so natural. How do
                            you talk about the internal growth, the pain, the struggles, and the setbacks when they are all brand new to you? I sometimes don’t even recognise myself through this new lens of isolation. It was easier when I could talk
                            about my awful trips to London, or my first hangover at a gay bar where I met one of my best friends, or any story about something that actually happened.
                            <br><br>
                            I often think about how our generation will go down in history.
                            <br><br>
                            Our grandparents went to war, telling us stories of their battles. What will we tell our grandkids? That we complained about being stuck inside for a few months while the clubs shut down? That we laughed at people in power
                            until they made us cry? That we took too long to fight for equality until one too many people died? We might just need to tell them that we were always a step behind, but always had the right intentions.
                            <br><br>
                            I am terrified of dying because I don't know how our story will be told.

                            I end up on this hill a lot, looking down at the people whose lives continue to pass by while mine runs still, a sad irony that is not lost on me. The houses look like a miniature architectural mockup; the people just
                            working ants, busy doing their jobs.
                            <br><br>
                            Mary is probably still tending to her chocolate shop, working until those late hours of the night like she used to, so that when the morning comes her customers can buy her freshly made goodies. They really are something
                            special.
                            <br><br>
                            John, her husband, is behind the counter counting the money they earned that day hoping it will be enough to pay back the unhappy customer that dropped the freshly baked chocolate cake Mary spent all day making.

                            Tina keeps singing at the bar across town knowing one day she will make it big. The crowd keeps throwing drinks at her but her commitment to her art is bigger than a few wet see-through T-shirts as her breasts illuminate
                            the stage.

                            Katherine jogs every morning and swims in her private pool every night. She has never understood the struggles of life or that you need to work to attain materialistic things or experiences. Money has never been a problem
                            for her. That is, what many would call, “pure fucking luck”.

                            has trouble handling it.

                            Everyone forgot about my death last week though. I was taking a stroll down to the corner store where Bob works, just to get a few snacks. I saw Jeffy stuck in a tree across the street and thought what a shame it must be
                            to cry for help with no one listening. I thought the cat deserved a break, and since the local firefighters were busy saving Cindy’s life across town from a burning building, I decided to cross the street. A poor decision
                            on my part, especially given the fact I forgot the basic rule taught to us all as children: always look left first.
                            <br><br>
                            Poor Jeffy; I hope he made it down.

                            This is what the routine looks like: he goes to work for about two weeks, is gone for one, and then spends the next few days in the hospital. Not what one would call the best life. I would like to feel sorry for the guy,

                            Jack is one of the many people that fail at committing suicide. He isn’t generally depressed either, but when a moment of true passion hits, and that passion mixes with that severe emptiness, he just has to go for the
                            knife.

                            You’d think he’d learn by now that killing yourself just isn’t that simple. It takes a lot to off yourself, and most people fail because they just don’t do it well enough; and thank God for that. Hospitals get tired of
                            those teenagers short of a few pills that decided their first breakup was just too much to continue living.

                            Not Jack though, he takes his tragedies to a whole other level. Jack likes to bleed publicly. All over the grocery stores, all over the parking lot, and once, all over a wedding dress. He wants people to watch, to pay
                            attention, and ultimately, wants to live. This fascinating mental cycle of Jack’s has him landing in the hospital monthly; the surgeon knows him by name.

                            One month however, Jack decided to stop. What’s interesting about that is we all came to ask ourselves “What’s wrong with Jack this month?” like it was somehow normal that cutting his wrists was the norm, and not doing so
                            made him crazy.
                            <br><br>
                            The reason for this break was a girl; beautiful, tall, and blue eyed. He had fallen hard. She was European, with a heavy German accent and gorgeous blonde hair. On the outside, she was his perfection, a perfect piece for
                            his puzzle mind.
                            <br><br>
                            One day however, Natasha did succeed where so many fail. She left without even a note to explain why. She was serious about it. She just wanted to be gone. Her attempt was successful because she chose a method that could
                            never fail; she drove up a mountain and flew off the other side. Clean break.
                            <br><br>
                            Jack grieved for weeks. One month passed by, two months passed by, and after three years of not attempting anything, I just had to know.
                            <br><br>
                            “Hey Jack, why’d you stop?” I asked.
                            <br><br>
                            “Got bored.” he said.
                            <br><br>
                            I had to double check that I had heard right. “You got bored?”
                            <br><br>
                            “Yeah.”
                            <br><br>
                            I didn’t know what to respond to that. His answer took me by surprise.
                            “Why do you ask?” he said.
                            <br><br>
                            “Honestly, because everyone in town is wondering; they just don’t have the guts to ask.” I said.
                            <br><br>
                            “That’s the thing about people, they spend so much unnecessary time asking themselves questions that have no answer. What a waste of life.” he said.
                            <br><br>
                            “So it really is that simple then, huh? You just got bored?” I said.
                            <br><br>
                            “Exactly.”
                            <br><br>
                            To this day I still wonder how the answer could have been so simple. With so much heartache, I somehow wanted the answer to be deeper, more painful; for my entertainment, so that I could have had a story to tell everyone
                            and be the center of attention. I wanted that high, the rush of knowing what others didn’t, and being the first to find out.
                            <br><br>
                            I wonder if part of him knew that.

                            I’m obsessed with you. Wherever you go, whatever you do, I want you. I know your weaknesses, things that scare you, how to get under your skin. When I watch you undress in front of your window it feels like you want people
                            to watch; or do you want me to watch? I don’t like hearing about the ones that came before me and got a taste of you, but if I don’t listen to what you say, how will I ever match them, be better than them, beat them at
                            their game? You text me when you have hard times, I come pick you back up, and then you fuck them instead of me.

                            This new toy you take into your bed is scum, did you know that? A shit lawyer that puts good people behind bars just to make a little bit more money at the end of the day. Your taste in toys leaves something to be desired,
                            darling.
                            <br><br>
                            I’m tired of sleeping in my car just to make sure you are alright. If you just chose me instead of them, things would be so much easier, relaxing, loving. We could be together, and I could keep you safe. Being in love with
                            you is driving me insane. I know you find safety with me, company, because you know me. I’m familiar. Is that why you don’t want me, because there just isn’t enough mystery to keep you interested? How the fuck am I
                            supposed to change that?
                            <br><br>
                            Morning comes and there goes the lawyer, walking out of your apartment without a care in world. Another day hard at work while you wash off your night endeavors under a cold shower with some morning whiskey. You are
                            beautiful, perfect in fact, and I stand in front of your window picturing myself under that stream of water with you.
                            <br><br>
                            Starting with some light kisses on your neck and working my way down to your back, I spin you around and work my way back up to your collarbone. Slowly taking off your clothes I make sure the bathroom steams up just right,
                            ditching that cold shower you think you want. I would make you mine better than others ever have, I can promise you that.
                            <br><br>
                            You were supposed to warn me before you cut so deep into my soul, love. I wasn’t prepared, and I don’t appreciate that. Maybe when they come looking for us, they will understand how unfair you’ve been. I don’t expect you
                            to understand me. I don’t expect you to want to. I don’t love her; you should know that. She is a replacement for the pain you caused. For the emptiness I feel because you never saw me, you never wanted me, you just never
                            fucking cared. So, when you find us, think of me for one of your shitty selfish seconds, because I know I would have been the best you’ve ever had.

                            How much do you think that this house is worth? Just look at these doors, they must cost thousands. My truck is outside in the sun, and I know once I come back those seats are going to be boiling. I hate my job; I have no
                            idea how I ended up here. This box is extremely heavy, but I am hesitating to put it down for some reason. The house just feels odd to me, and there’s no one home. What if someone steals this, then it’s going to be my
                            fault for not being careful enough. I should probably check around the house to see if there might be another spot I can put this.
                            <br><br>
                            All of the doors seem closed and I am still carrying this heavy thing. What’s in here anyway? I need to put this down for a second, my hands are about to give in. I know this house, I deliver their mail every day and yet
                            somehow today it just feels oddly quiet. Someone is always home, and most of the time what I assume are the husband and wife argue loudly. It’s always about really boring stuff, like where the silverware goes, and how he
                            needs to rinse the dishes before her puts them in the dishwasher. It’s really much too quiet today.
                            <br><br>
                            My car is heating up and I left my door open which is going to be an extra blow. I hate my work in the summer, especially because I always have to have my windows down so it never cools off. I feel like I have been
                            standing here awkwardly for the last ten minutes. Why can’t I just leave? I think I should open the front door. Well, it’s unlocked. Oh no, what do I do now? Now I definitely can’t leave, they forgot to lock their door. I
                            need to stay here to guard the house.
                            <br><br>
                            It’s getting really hot out here. It feels really cool in there. I shouldn’t go in though, that would be an invasion of privacy. Or would it be, if I am only doing it for selfless reasons? I am after all, just protecting
                            them. Alright, I’m going in, but I am just going to sit on the couch until I feel like it is safe to leave.
                            <br><br>
                            Oh no, I must have dozed off. What’s the time? Do I hear them coming? I need to get out of here fast.
                            <br><br>
                            “Honey, why is the mailman’s car here?” asks the wife.
                            <br><br>
                            “Not sure, it seems to still be running. How strange.”
                            <br><br>
                            “Do you see him anywhere?”
                            <br><br>
                            “I don’t think so. Wasn’t Annie’s package supposed to arrive today?” he says.
                            <br><br>
                            “That’s what she told me.”
                            <br><br>
                            I hear them approaching the house. Hiding in the bathroom was not the most clever idea. I should have just unlocked one of the other eight doors in the house and ran. I am so stupid.
                            <br><br>
                            “Did you forget to lock the door?” she says.
                            <br><br>
                            “That’s the third time that happened to me. I’m sorry honey, maybe it’s time I finally see that doctor you recommended.”
                            <br><br>
                            They are inside the house now. I can’t go anywhere, I’m officially stuck here.
                            <br><br>
                            “Honey, is this the package?” she asks.
                            <br><br>
                            “How on earth did this get inside?” he asks.
                            <br><br>
                            “Maybe it came this morning and you forgot about it? It wouldn’t be the first time, you know. We really should get you checked.” she says.
                            <br><br>
                            I need to get out of here before they realize I’m here.
                            <br><br>
                            “I will be right back to help with those groceries, just going to the bathroom.” she says.
                            <br><br>
                            Well, now I’m screwed.
                            <br><br>
                            I hide into their bathroom closet. I can barely fit in here. What’s that smell? Please let this be over soon, I can’t breathe in here. I can hear her coming into the bathroom, door is opening and closing, the sink turns
                            on, and the shower? Is she taking a shower? What the fuck is happening, I can’t stay here for…
                            <br><br>
                            “So, do you want to come out or should I make you come out?”
                            <br><br>
                            Fuck. Who is she talking to? Is she on the phone?
                            <br><br>
                            “I won’t ask twice.”
                            <br><br>
                            I need to stay perfectly still. Don’t breathe. Don’t move.
                            <br><br>
                            She opens the closet.

                            I’ve been kicking this stupid pebble for over 5 minutes, and I probably moved an inch. School’s out and I need to be walking home to meet my parents for lunch, but I just can’t seem to get myself moving. They just haven’t
                            been my safe space lately, and I feel like I’m going through a lot of shit. I’m often misunderstood and when I try to be polite and nice, I am just seen as selfish. Such is a day in the life of a teenager.
                            <br><br>
                            My days are overwhelmed by thoughts of failure. I’m not doing enough at home, my grades aren’t what my parents want them to be, I don’t have any raw talents for art or music, and most of all, I can’t seem to get myself
                            motivated enough to accomplish much. Not the best.
                            <br><br>
                            I have a boyfriend who is into playing video games, so when we aren’t in school I don’t really see him much. I tried to get into the world of consoles and controllers, but it really doesn’t interest me. So aside from
                            making out in the hallway and pissing off our teachers, there is not much there in the love department of moi.
                            <br><br>
                            My sense of style is very somber. Mostly dark greys and blacks. I don’t like to showcase myself in front of people or give them any reason to judge me; I do that enough myself. Honesty is something I value above all else,
                            so if I catch you in lie you have probably lost my trust forever. This little quirk of mine burned itself into my brain after I walked in on my mother having sex with a man that was not my father when I was 7. Not a memory
                            I had hoped would stick around, but it has and now I live with it by not being a lying whore.
                            <br><br>
                            “Hey sweetie, how was school?” asks my mom.
                            <br><br>
                            Yay, I made it home just in time for lunch. I wonder what’s on today’s menu from all the three meals we ever eat.
                            <br><br>
                            “Your dad can’t make it today. He is stuck at work.”
                            <br><br>
                            Of course he is. Ever since he fired poor Rhonda, his secretary of fifteen years, and got a newer, much younger model, dad has been missing family lunches often. Mom knows, but she is too busy downing bottles of red Merlot
                            to care. She can’t really be the one to say anything, she started it.
                            <br><br>
                            “What’s for lunch, mom?” I ask.
                            <br><br>
                            “I thought we could just order in today. It’s that kind of a day.”
                            <br><br>
                            Beats her cooking by a long shot, so I eagerly oblige with that request. Pizza sounds nice right about now. Dad won’t be home for hours since he is too busy screwing Amanda on the front desk, and mom’s two bottles are
                            starting to show, so she’ll be out cold here shortly.
                            <br><br>
                            When the curtains close behind our white picket fence the demons really do come out. Picture perfect family on the outside, broken as shit on the inside. A story that will never be told. What the heck, I’m 16 now, maybe a
                            glass of red for me as well?
                            <br><br>
                            “What do you say mom? Can I join you with a glass of wine?”
                            <br><br>
                            “Sure thing sweetie.”
                            <br><br>
                            My future is bright.

                            I sing my heart out to kids at birthday parties, at home, while they drive in cars, anywhere! It’s my job if we want to be more specific. The songs most requested are “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”, “The Itsy Bitsy Spider”,
                            and “The Happy Song”. If you woke me up at 3am, I could sing those to you in reverse.
                            <br><br>
                            I am still quite young myself, only three weeks old. They make me change color, depending what scene I’m performing, so I get confused on what my identity should be sometimes. I feel like a lot of people identify
                            themselves by what they wear, and since I can’t just pick and choose my outfit, I’m stuck listening to others telling me what to do.
                            <br><br>
                            I’m not human though, I’m sure you know. Oh, but I love to dance! Do you love dancing? I made up this dance to Row, Row, Row Your Boat all on my own just the other day, and now I’m waiting on my Tik Tok account approval
                            from my mom. I hear it’s all the rage, but she doesn’t seem too convinced.
                            <br><br>
                            The sad part is, I don’t ever meet the kids I sing or dance to. They see me and I see them, but I can never talk to them. We could all be such good friends if I wasn’t stuck in here. Maybe some day they’ll grow up into
                            amazing developers with the ability to create a way for me to talk to them. That would be so exciting!
                            <br><br>
                            Please don’t feel too sad for me though. I love my job, and it makes me very happy. Seeing those kids and their parents smile and laugh is one of my biggest accomplishments. I just wish I could enjoy it with them, that’s
                            all.
                            <br><br>
                            Anyway, Mom is calling me back for dinner. Tonight, we are having tiger, but don’t ever tell your kids that. They can only ever see us eating human food, so don’t tell them that things aren’t what they seem. It would crush
                            them. When they ask to watch Dinosaurus Freddy, just let me do my job in making your children laugh while you hold and love them. The world is much too cruel out there. Let’s keep them safe just a little while longer.
                            <br><br>
                            It was nice talking to you, but I really must go. Mom is getting mad at me. See you when you Google me. I’ll be there to make you smile.

                            I didn’t think this through. When I took a hammer to your head I kind of figured that would be the end of my problems, but even in death you continue to be a royal pain in my ass. I should probably be surprised, but I’m
                            not. You always were the scum of the earth.
                            <br><br>
                            Now I need to figure out what to do with your stupid lifeless body. You look better with a cracked skull, so that’s a positive. I just got this dress by the way; of course, you’d ruin this for me too. Asshole.
                            <br><br>
                            So, how do people do this? Do I burn your body in the woods and keep your teeth? The internet is my friend. Let’s Google this shit. “How to get rid of dead body” is probably a start. Ah, fuck, too gruesome. Turning off my
                            phone now, I got this. I’m hungry, I’ll get back to you in a sec.
                            <br><br>
                            Ok, so I needed a nap. Sorry for the delay. Still bleeding all over my floor as selfishly as you lived. In death you are still the same fuck as in life. I got the bleach for my floor and am going to wrap you up in blankets
                            to put you in the trunk of my car. This is a solid plan, don’t fight me on this one. Ha, I’m funny.
                            <br><br>
                            Cool. In the woods now. Wish I didn’t have to pull out your teeth, but beats prison by a long stretch. They never quite fit your mouth anyway, so you are welcome. I could really use a glass of wine right now. That bubble
                            bath waiting for me at home sounds heavenly.
                            <br><br>
                            Alright, ding-dong your teeth are gone. Let’s light your ass on fire and party! I should probably burn this dress too. A few parting words are in order don’t you think? Only fair for all the shit you and I have been
                            through.
                            <br><br>
                            Ok, here I go:
                            <br>
                            Dress, we haven’t had a long relationship, but you served me well. We’ve been together through life and death, two partners in crime. Your color, like the sun that shines on all the earth made my body look smoking hot. I
                            appreciate you for that. We unfortunately never took a picture together as your life ended too soon, but you will be remembered in my memories forever. You shall be deeply missed.
                            <br><br>
                            Jimmy, burn in hell dude. Say hi to Pop for me.

                            Dear Diary,
                            <br>
                            It’s 1967 on a Tuesday. Time to end my life. I shall bury you in the yard in front of the olive tree. No parting words on my end, since I don’t really have anything to say. I would burn you, but I think that would be a
                            waste. A wooden box buried in the dirt seems like the way to go. Books will never be written about women like me, so make sure to pass on my legacy.
                            <br><br>
                            Dear Diary,
                            <br>
                            I found you buried in the ground when I tried to plant my garden. It’s been 50 years since your last owner abandoned you. Sorry for that, that must have been hard. I bought this house two years ago, wish I found you
                            sooner. You’ve had quite a past.
                            I’m a social worker living in Brooklyn, but you know that already. I figured I would write a few things here in memory of you, but I really am not the person who should ultimately have you. I think it’s best I bury you
                            again so you can be found by someone worthy.
                            <br><br>
                            Dear Diary,
                            <br>
                            This writing chain is insane. So, people bury and unbury you? Kinda fun, have to admit. I’m on my phone like pretty much always, so doing something different is pretty cool. I’m 16 and moved into this house about a month
                            ago. The previous owner told me about you. It’s been three years since she last saw you. I don’t write like at all, so figured I would introduce myself and then put you back. Til the next person.
                            <br><br>
                            Dear Diary,
                            <br>
                            The world is falling apart. The last entry was 20 years ago. Unfortunately, the house that used to be here burned down. The old owner was a sociopath and killed his entire family. This was found in evidence, and I just
                            couldn’t bear to have them keep you in a box forever. You have too much history. I can’t put you back where you’ve always been, so I am finding a new spot for you on the other side of town. Hope you meet some great people
                            there.
                            <br><br>

                            No names revealed of your previous guests. That’s quite the mystery. I won’t break the tradition then. Year is 2095 and you’ve been found on my property. Life has changed quite a bit since your first owner. Most things
                            have gone virtual now, I rarely see anyone with a book or pad. It’s actually quite fortunate that the last person left you with a pen; all my pens only work for screens. I’m a computer engineer, nice to have met you.

                            Year is 3024. Found preserved in life box. Intact. Very good condition. Pen ink dried out. Writing with laser. Nice to meet you. Will put you back in life box.

                            We collectively decided on suicide. It wasn’t a statement. We were just old and wanted to leave this world on our terms. We thought that was ok.
                            <br><br>
                            On the first day we got together to figure out the supplies we needed. Ropes, drugs, guns, anything we could get our hands on. Some of us wanted quick deaths, others wanted a more painful experience. To each their own.
                            <br><br>
                            Day two was more of a struggle. It was the day for suicide notes. We weren’t sure what to write especially because no one would see this coming. How to write everything out in a note so that our family members wouldn’t
                            need to ask themselves unnecessary questions?
                            <br><br>
                            The third day got easier. We decided to take that one off to spend some time with our loved ones. Funny thing about planning a suicide is your mind just isn’t quite in the present moment anymore. We hoped we faked it well
                            enough they would have a good last memory of us.
                            <br><br>
                            Day four was the day of the hike. We collectively decided on a cave at the top of the mountain that surrounded our neighborhood. We might or might not be found, which is the magic of it all. We decided to park at the
                            bottom and hike the rest of the way up, just in case they did find us, we would make it easier without adding the car to lug down. We were considerate.
                            <br><br>
                            On day five we finally made it to the cave. The view of our neighborhood was gorgeous, and the sunset was one of the most beautiful we had ever seen. We brought food and alcohol to celebrate the end of us.
                            <br><br>
                            On day six we woke up with a massive hangover. Not the way to die. Decided to wait one more day to do it right.
                            <br><br>
                            On day seven we collectively joined hands, closed our eyes and prayed. Today was the day the world would lose some good people, but one would remain.
                            <br><br>
                            I lost all my 7 personalities that day. I burned Cindy, hanged Jordan, strangled Jimmy, shot Amy and Allen, drowned George in the pond, and threw Andrew over the cliff. Quite the slaughter. Getting rid of them was the best
                            thing that’s ever happened to me. I can finally sleep at night.

                            She steps through the front door like she doesn’t have a care in the world. That’s who she’s always been; a nonchalant imposter who fakes her way through everything she’s ever accomplished. In college she slept with her
                            English professor just to land her first book deal. She went on to screw the publisher at the publishing company so she could get a higher percentage from the sales. She continues to wear that shiny red lipstick and fake
                            eyelashes so she can feel young while approaching her late 50s.
                            <br><br>
                            She has not aged well. Skinnier than ever, wearing her hair up in a bun she sits down at the table to “chat”. Fucking fraud.
                            <br><br>
                            “Have you read it yet?” she asks.
                            <br><br>
                            “No mother. I have not.” I say.

                            “Well you should. It’s very good.”
                            <br><br>
                            “Of course, you would say that about your own book.” I say.
                            <br><br>
                            Rolling her eyes, she stands up to grab a glass from the cupboard. She washes it again, because the way I wash dishes just isn’t good enough.
                            <br><br>
                            “Your short story is cute. I read it this morning. Leaves a lot to be desired, but you’ll get there.” she says.
                            <br><br>
                            “Thanks. Sweet compliment.” I say.
                            <br><br>
                            “Oh, don’t be so dramatic. I was just trying to be nice.”
                            <br><br>
                            Worst thing to say to someone. Hatred can’t begin to describe what I feel for this woman. She is so self-absorbed my father offed himself because of her. Just decided one day that jumping off a bridge would literally be
                            something that made him happier than listen to her incessant ranting. She still doesn’t feel an ounce of regret about the situation. That’s crazy to me.
                            <br><br>
                            “Got a boyfriend yet?” she asks.
                            <br><br>
                            “No. I don’t.”

                            “Why?”
                            <br><br>
                            “Primarily because I like girls.” I say.
                            <br><br>
                            “You do? Since when?”
                            <br><br>
                            “Just something I decided to try on for size yesterday.”
                            <br><br>
                            “Really?”
                            <br><br>
                            “No, mom. I am obviously kidding. Fuck, you know I’m gay. This isn’t new information. Is there a reason you’re here, and can we get to it?” I say.
                            <br><br>
                            “Can’t a mother just come check up on her daughter?”
                            <br><br>
                            “Yes, a mother can. Also, a mother can show her way to the door and go. A daughter would prefer that.”
                            <br><br>
                            “Fine. This envelope came for you yesterday. Read it, burn it, I don’t care. Don’t come crying to me about it later though. I’m a busy woman.”
                            <br><br>
                            She hands me the envelope, puts on her jacket, scarf and hat, and leaves just as fast as she came. Good riddance. That was painful.
                            <br><br>
                            The letter reads:
                            <br><br>
                            “Dear Ava,
                            <br><br>
                            Hey kiddo. So, I’m not actually dead. I know we haven’t talked in over twenty years and my supposed death was probably quite hard on you, but I have been living in the mountains all this time. It has been quite a life.
                            Anyway, long story short, if you are reading this, I am actually dead now. No joke, I swear. Dead and cold, all the way. Anyway, I decided to write this quick note so you would understand why I did what I did.
                            <br><br>
                            Your mom is an awful human. I’m so sad for you that you had to be raised by such a selfish crow. Hopefully she didn’t completely mess you up. I didn’t really feel like dealing with her anymore, so I faked my own death and
                            went to live in peace and harmony with nature.
                            <br><br>
                            Watching over you now from the heavens. Stay sane.

                            I change my mind a lot. I kind of hate it because I feel like I can’t focus on one thing in life. Sometimes I love to paint, other times I love to sing, and sometimes I just can’t decide on what I want, so I get low. That
                            doesn’t really give me a lot of chances to figure out a steady career and income. The problem is all too real, yet somehow, I don’t have the motivation to fix it.
                            <br><br>
                            I get into an odd headspace at times where I justify my inconsistency. "Life is short, we could all die tomorrow," and the typical existential excuses one says to feel better are a part of my daily vocabulary. Sad thing
                            is, those dreadful truths do apply, just not quite in the way I use them.
                            <br><br>
                            One great example of when I resort to my justifications is when I talk about credit card debt. It is so much easier to just live life and forget the rest because you might not have one soon. Realizing you might be sent to
                            collections and you could be jeopardizing your future seems like a much more stressful approach.
                            <br><br>
                            During a worldwide pandemic, any sort of resemblance of an eventuality is quite faded, and a simple thought such as “enjoy the moment now while you have it” seems to calm me. I don’t think that’s wrong. We all need to
                            figure out ways to get out of bed in the morning without feeling like our worlds have shattered.
                            <br><br>
                            I consider myself fairly lucky though. My dogs and cats keep me company, my family continues to be supportive of my hobby refinements, and I sit here doing my due diligence by staying the fuck inside to give those who need
                            it a fighting chance. Our fellow compatriots fighting for their lives should be thought of and remembered. They are us; we are them, and collectively we can heal together from this 2020 horror novel slowly, and with
                            patience.
                            <br><br>
                            Until then, c’est la vie.

                            He had lived 50 years in this house, yet he was standing in an unfamiliar hallway. He wondered why the paintings that hung on the walls felt so foreign, and why the lights were dimmer than he had preferred them.
                            <br><br>
                            “Dementia had finally gotten the better of me.” he thought, but then quickly remembered he was never actually diagnosed with it.
                            <br><br>
                            “I guess that would be too easy of an answer.”
                            <br><br>
                            Walking down the freshly stretched out carpet, the air seemed to be getting thinner, and the door that used to lead down to the basement was no longer there.
                            <br><br>
                            “That’s strange.” he thought.
                            <br><br>
                            Continuing to walk down the hallway, feeling as if it was never ending, it all felt more and more like a dream. For a moment it seemed almost as if the walls moved around him while he stood still. He knew it wasn’t a dream
                            though, it felt more real than that.
                            <br><br>
                            “Strange… that painting’s new. I don’t remember hanging it there. It’s quite ugly.” he said.
                            <br><br>
                            “I hung it there.” said a voice. “I think it looks nice. It fits with the rest of the ensemble.”
                            <br><br>
                            He turned around to see who was talking to him, but no one was there. Confused he stopped in his tracks, but the walls continued to move. Beethoven’s 5th Symphony started to play in the background, and soon it consumed the
                            entire hallway. Lights started to slowly brighten as the music approached its crescendo, and the air around him got colder, leaving him shivering where he stood.
                            <br><br>
                            Everything went dark for a moment.
                            <br><br>
                            “Keep talking to him. He can hear you.” said a voice.
                            <br><br>
                            “Hello?” he said.
                            <br><br>
                            The voices were muffled, but he could hear more people joining in. They sounded familiar, he just couldn’t quite make out who they were or what they were saying.
                            <br><br>
                            “Hello? Can you hear me?” he said.
                            <br><br>
                            The music was so loud now the only way to be heard through it was by screaming.
                            <br><br>
                            “Hey! I’m right here! Can you hear me?” he yelled.
                            <br><br>
                            The lights turned back on and started to get brighter, as if a rocket ship approaching the sun. It was unbearable to keep his eyes open, so he tried covering them with his hands. One of the lightbulbs in front of him
                            exploded, then another one, a third one, one after the other. The darkness crept towards him leaving him no choice but to turn and run the other way from where he presumably came from.
                            <br><br>
                            “Help! Help me!” he yelled.
                            <br><br>
                            The music rose to a thunderous volume, the darkness creeping behind him seemed unstoppable, and just as he was about to stop running, he noticed the walls stood still again. The painting he’d never seen before hung
                            stationary beside him as he continued to run, the floor of the hallway moving faster, like a treadmill.
                            <br><br>
                            Then it all stopped.
                            <br><br>
                            For a second, he could breathe again. That’s all he needed. The music shut off, the air got warmer, and the lights on his side of the hallways dimmed again.
                            <br><br>
                            “I’m not sure how long. It could be years. I’m so sorry.” he heard them talking.
                            <br><br>
                            “Hello?” he called out.
                            <br><br>
                            “They can’t hear you.” said the voice.
                            <br><br>
                            “Who are you?”
                            <br><br>
                            “I’m you. The part of you still out there somewhere. I’m here to stay though, if you need me; misery loves company, and I have a feeling we might be stuck here for a while. We had quite the accident.”
                            <br><br>
                            “I don’t understand. Am I dead?” he said.
                            <br><br>
                            “No, but we’re not living either.”
                            <br><br>
                            “So, what do I do now?”
                            <br><br>
                            “We start walking. The door we need is at the end of the hallway.”
                            <br><br>
                            With a serene sad confusion, he started to walk.
                            <br><br>
                            “Not that way. The other way.”
                            <br><br>
                            He turned around to face the darkness. It’s at that moment that he realized where he was, why he was, and what his chances were of finding that door. He stopped to stare at the nothingness that used to be him. The memories
                            that hung on his walls, the lights that used to illuminate his path, and the soundtrack to his life, all gone. A part of his core self, just a dark hole in his brain.
                            <br><br>
                            “I think I’ll just sit here and appreciate this painting you hung for a while. Come join me.” he said.

                            I feel like a waste of space. Angry, useless, and talentless. I hide under my covers, escaping my responsibilities, and in doing so, complete the thought that makes me feel pointless full circle. 
                            <br><br>
                            I've cried more tears today than the short 5-minute rainfall we got in the drought we live in. I'm being asked why the tears keep flowing, and I don’t have an answer. It’s everything, and it’s nothing. 
                            <br><br>
                            Watching TV shows in bed makes me feel like a lazy nothing of a human, and my dogs are barking outside that they need to be fed. I can’t even get up to get a glass of water, so I stay dehydrated rather than get the fuck
                            out of bed.
                            <br><br>
                            Going for a walk seems like so much work, reading a book is impossible because the words blur into nothingness, and my body is yelling at me to move my ass because it’s getting bored.
                            <br><br>
                            I'm yelling at myself in my head because I am too busy staring into nothingness to be vocal. My cat sleeps besides me, snoring just lightly enough that I hate it, so I kick him out of the room. He meows to be let back in,
                            and the incessant noise drives me to hide in the corner of my closet.
                            <br><br>
                            I am grieving my life, my every day, and my future. I don’t have a reason for it, I don’t know why, and I don’t know what brought it on. Clearly the feeling has no intention of leaving for now, so I can accept it or not,
                            but either way, I'm the one sitting on the floor of my closet soaking in my own tears while my dogs howl into the night.

                            I got locked inside my dogs’ crate. Two hours later and I still can’t get my brother to let me out. As per our agreement, I sing the songs he wants me to sign, and he lets me out no questions asked. I've been singing long
                            enough now that my throat is dry.
                            <br><br>
                            My dog keeps staring at me in confusion. I tried yelling for someone to let me out, but I don't think anyone can hear me. My brother is sitting in the living room watching TV and not paying attention to my yelling. It
                            seems as if he got bored of our little game and has now taken to another task.
                            <br><br>
                            The doorbell rings and I try to yell for whoever’s there to come inside, but they don’t hear me. The doorbell rings again and I yell even louder, my voice cracks under the pressure. Still nothing. Minutes later they are
                            gone and I am still left locked between these bars.
                            <br><br>
                            It has been four hours and no sign of help. My brother seems fast asleep now and my dog lays in his spot at the corner in the kitchen. I can’t believe this is happening to me. How could I have predicted I would end up
                            being locked in a crate by my very own brother? It’s starting to feel like torture, and I am on the verge of tears and panic.
                            <br><br>
                            He wakes up and comes in to check up on me. I beg him to let me out, but instead he chooses to jump on the bed laughing at me. I start to shake the crate, harder, until it tips over to its side taking me with it. The latch
                            still intact keeps me locked inside, and my attempt to get out fails.
                            <br><br>
                            Tortured, thirsty, and hungry I finally fall asleep. I can’t seem to keep my strength together long enough to do something productive with it. Panicked and angry, I lie on my side hoping this ends soon.
                            <br><br>
                            A few hours later I get woken up by mother coming to my rescue. I try to collect my thoughts, my eyesight still hazy from my nap. I crawl out of the cage, my dog running past me to make sure I didn’t change too much while
                            I was in there. I thank my mom for saving me and rub my eyes one more time to clear my sight. Standing next to me is my little three-year-old brother with a tear running down his cheek, and hugs me apologetically.
                            <br><br>
                            “I sowwy.” he says as I hug him back, reassuring him I still love him unconditionally.

                            “Vodka Martini please” I told the bartender.
                            <br><br>
                            I had a long day that day. I decided to be spontaneous and instead of stopping by Charlie’s like I did every night, I thought I would try this new bar downtown. The big city continued to drown me into its noise, and no
                            matter how loud I screamed, I was unheard.
                            <br><br>
                            “Do you want an olive with that?” the bartender yelled at me through the music.
                            <br><br>
                            “No thanks, I hate olives.”
                            <br><br>
                            With a slight nod of his head, he prepared my drink with a practiced fluency and a heavy hand with the upended vodka bottle. At least someone was listening to me. Music was playing in the background picked by someone with
                            no taste. It made my day worse.
                            <br><br>
                            “Hi, I'd like a whiskey neat, please.”
                            <br><br>
                            The bartender looked at the man that sat next to me and nodded.
                            <br><br>
                            “Right away, sir.” he said.
                            <br><br>
                            Maybe someone was actually having a worse day than I was. Oddly enough, that made me feel good. I wasn’t alone in my miserable world.
                            <br><br>
                            “Bad day?” I asked the man.
                            <br><br>
                            “Not bad, just busy. It’s nice though, living in a big city staying busy makes you feel less alone.”
                            <br><br>
                            “Tell me about it.” I rolled my eyes a little.
                            <br><br>
                            “I take it you have had a bad day?”
                            <br><br>
                            “Bad days are a staple in my world.” I said.
                            <br><br>
                            “How so?”
                            <br><br>
                            “I’m a musician living in Los Angeles – you know how it goes.”
                            <br><br>
                            “Unfortunately, I do.”
                            <br><br>
                            “Now I'm intrigued. You a musician?” I asked.
                            <br><br>
                            “Depends. Can I hear some of your stuff?”
                            <br><br>
                            “Sure. Here’s my website. Hopefully you find something you like.”
                            <br><br>
                            He stood up, thanked me and excused himself to take a phone call. I kept drinking my martini watching people around me continue to get drunker as the night got darker.
                            <br><br>
                            He came back a few minutes later, grabbed his jacket and handed me a card.
                            <br><br>
                            “Here, take this.” He said. “Call me tomorrow. I want to talk to you about your music.”
                            <br><br>
                            He rushed out of the bar as quickly as he came into it. He really was a busy man.
                            <br><br>
                            I looked down at the card he handed to me. The card read John Daniels, Music Producer and Owner of Entertainment LA Music Label.
                            <br><br>
                            I turned the card around and there was a handwritten note:
                            <br><br>
                            “Your life is about to change. Enjoy that drink.”
                            <br><br>
                            The music in the background drowned into my excited heartbeat, and I enjoyed my last drink of normalcy.

                            Born and raised in Serbia in 1936, he was a mischievous child. He never let anything stop him from achieving his goals, and he grew up to be a successful architect.
                            <br><br>
                            After a long battle with cancer, his wife of many years passed. Left alone with a son, he needed a fresh start. A few months later, they moved to the beautiful tropical city of Caracas, Venezuela and started their new
                            life.
                            <br><br>
                            On Wednesday, May 13, 1968, he was stopped at a red light and an older lady tried transitioning her car from one lane to another where there was clearly no room for her, somehow causing even more unnecessary stoppage in an
                            already congested avenue. Angry that she didn’t know how and where to position her car amidst the rush hour traffic, he rolled down his window and started yelling profanities at her in his native tongue.
                            <br><br>
                            “Jebem ti sunce, majku da ti jebem! Pa gde se sad nadje ti ovde!?”
                            <br><br>
                            Translation (in a milder form): “Fuck you! How the hell did you end up here!?”
                            <br><br>
                            He continued to yell at the poor old woman, letting out his anger. In the midst of rush hour traffic in a large city, she was bound to be used to people yelling things at her. He would have chosen to yell at her in
                            Spanish, but since it was still quite rusty, he settled for a language she wouldn’t understand.
                            <br><br>
                            “Vozi ajde! O jebote!” (Drive already, fuck!”), he continued.
                            <br><br>
                            Waving his hands at her to move forward, she suddenly turned around toward his direction and very slowly rolled down the passenger window. Tilting her head, so she could peek out to see what all the yelling was about, he
                            continued to gesture violently, clearly indicating he was out of patience. He needed to communicate what he needed from her somehow since language was a barrier.
                            <br><br>
                            Her face turned from amusement to anger as he continued yelling at her; finally, she'd had enough and yelled back:
                            <br><br>
                            “Pa dal se tako govori starijoj gospodji!?” (“Is that how you speak to an older lady!?”)
                            <br><br>
                            Shocked at the words he just heard come out her mouth he sheepishly rolled up his window and proceeded to mind his own business in shame. It was just his luck, that in the middle of Caracas, during rush hour, he would yell
                            at the only other Serbian trying to get home from work.
                            <br><br>
                            Goes to show you, Dad, be careful what you say and what language you say it in, you never know who your audience might be.
                            <br><br>
                            He searched for years to try and find the woman and apologize to her for his very rude behavior. He never found her.

                            My cat continued staring at me as I talked to myself in the mirror.
                            <br><br>
                            “I could have done things differently. Maybe gone to college and gotten that science degree my dad always wanted me to get. Or, maybe I should have dropped out of high school and joined my girlfriends rock band.”
                            <br><br>
                            As questions continued crossing my mind, I heard a knock on the door. My cat jumped off the bathroom counter he was comfortably staring at me from and ran to the door.
                            <br><br>
                            “Fuck, I'm not ready yet. I guess I'll have to do as I am.”
                            <br><br>
                            I walked to the door and made sure to collect my thoughts before turning the doorknob.
                            <br><br>
                            “Wait, not yet.” I said to myself.
                            <br><br>
                            I started to sweat a little bit. How did I get here? What do you even talk about on a date? It had been so long.
                            <br><br>
                            “Born and raised in Minnesota, graduated high school, learned to drive a car at 25, broke my leg at 27, was homeless for a little while with an alcohol problem, got myself back up again wining a lottery ticket, did an
                            online tech course, became a programmer, living in New York in a studio apartment on the 10th floor, 45 years old, downloaded a dating app because I was lonely, and here we are.”
                            <br><br>
                            Another knock on the door.
                            <br><br>
                            “Shit, not yet, not yet. What am I missing? Am I missing anything?”
                            <br><br>
                            I continued to scavenge around my brain for residual memories that would give me quick answers to any questions that might be waiting for me in the hallway.
                            <br><br>
                            “No pets, dead parents, no siblings, hate cilantro, love almond ice-cream, tolerate cooking, 15 years sober, can’t sit through a movie, and spend most my days in front of my laptop.”
                            <br><br>
                            Another knock.
                            <br><br>
                            “Why is this so hard?”
                            <br><br>
                            I kept pacing back and forth trying to find some sort of answer. All of my collective decisions have brought me here, to this very moment, and my future is knocking at my door.
                            <br><br>
                            “Let it in already!” I yelled at myself.
                            <br><br>
                            My hand still wasn’t reaching the doorknob.
                            <br><br>
                            “Pull yourself together. You are ready. The time is now.”
                            <br><br>
                            I checked my watch. It’s been 10 minutes. How did I let it go on for so long?
                            <br><br>
                            My hand rushed to open the door knob.
                            <br><br>
                            “I’m so sorry to keep you waiting. Please come in.” I said.
                            <br><br>
                            Standing at my doorway was a light breeze from my date walking away closing the elevator door signaling a sweet “fuck you” my way.
                            <br><br>
                            I let in what was left of the emptiness at my doorway, welcoming my lonely future in for a glass of wine I desperately craved.
                            <br><br>

                            My girlfriend says she’s fat, but she’s not. I wish I could understand why she feels that way about herself. Who, during her twenty something years of life, made her believe that the word “fat” should be used in her
                            vocabulary?
                            <br><br>
                            It’s a systemic problem I wish was not reality. This notion that a person needs to look a certain way is completely beyond me. Don’t we all come in different sizes, minds, and personalities? Isn’t that what makes this
                            world so colorful and beautiful?
                            <br><br>
                            We were granted the privilege to live on the only inhabitable planet in our solar system with the ability and power to choose our friends, lovers, acquaintances, and strangers, all based on our personal preferences. We now
                            use that privilege by giving its power to an arbitrary medium to educate us on what beauty is. Does that even make sense to you?
                            <br><br>
                            I want to tell my girlfriend this; life is so much more than your flat stomach, smooth hair, and perfect shade of lipstick. Life is happiness, because you've finally written that book you've spent years writing, taken your
                            first steps after a car accident, and given birth to a new life. Life is tears, because you were bullied for being different, you struggle with gender identity, and suffer from PTSD because you were raised by an alcoholic
                            parent. Life is indifference, because you can’t always feel everything, because sometimes everything is too much, and because sometimes life just is. Life is the mistakes you make, the paths you take, your inevitable
                            choices, and your biggest dreams. It’s the desire to find your purest sense of self, and be completely you.
                            <br><br>
                            How the hell can I yell at you about this now, knowing you can’t hear me through your coffin?

                            I never should have gotten on this plane. Sitting beside a kid with a vendetta towards his father and a recently thirty something widowed woman is making my migraine worse. I popped a pill before we boarded, but it seems
                            to be wearing off faster than I'd like. I figured I would at least get a nap in before landing, but it seems my wishes are futile at best.
                            <br><br>
                            The flight attendant seems to be having a rough day as well, so we have been telepathically commutating our grief to each other through looks.
                            <br><br>
                            The kid besides me is yelling at his father while the widowed woman cries for her lost companion. I turn around to comfort her by asking her to tell me her story.
                            <br><br>
                            “I loved her so much,” she said. “But cancer eventually took her from me. I am flying to Greece where we met, so I can scatter her ashes over the ocean. She wanted to learn to fly after she died.”
                            <br><br>
                            After we chat, she falls asleep and the kid also calms down watching an animated movie. His father relieved to be free from all the yelling shoots me an apologetic look. I nod in understanding, reassuring him I accept his
                            sincere apology.
                            <br><br>
                            I stand up to go to the bathroom only to realize all of them are occupied. At least I get to stretch my legs while I wait.
                            <br><br>
                            “So, what’s your name?”
                            <br><br>
                            I abruptly turn around, the flight attendant smiling at me.
                            <br><br>
                            “Evan.” I blush.
                            <br><br>
                            This strange feeling of excitement rushes through my body, and I hope the flight attendant stays to continue talking to me. I haven’t felt this way in a very long time. Years ago, my heart got so broken I didn’t know if I
                            was ever going to recover. For some reason, I feel it again as I talk to the flight attendant and I hope it lingers a while. I missed it.
                            <br><br>
                            “Nice to meet you Evan. I'm David.”

                            It spins around on the ceiling blowing air at me, and I feel oddly uncomfortable by the heat on my skin it’s trying to repel. As my dog lounges beside his bed on the floor I can’t help but wonder how much longer I'll need
                            to deal with such unacceptable conditions. Even the mouse in the corner of my closet can’t seem to muster the strength to stay hidden from me, so we made a deal not to invade each other’s spaces.
                            <br><br>
                            This mouse, my dog and I have engaged in a staring battle somewhere mid-melting. The game was simple: don’t look away. This concept seems easy enough, but who do you stare at when in a group of three? Seems unfair if the
                            mouse and dog both stare at me, while I stare back at the mouse. Now no one's watching the dog. All eyes in a lot of pressure.
                            <br><br>
                            Sweat starts to drip down my forehead and into my left eye. I keep staring, because I can’t feel a thing.
                            <br><br>
                            After a few minutes, my eye is drenched in sweat, but the game is too intense. I am not about to lose to a mouse and a dog. I need to up my game.
                            <br><br>
                            The air still circulates the room, cooling off the premises and surrounding areas. Everything becomes more breathable. I feel like I can feel my skin smiling back at me, and this is when I realize I am still in a 3-way
                            staring competition with my two animal friends.
                            <br><br>
                            No one is looking at the dog. Why is no one looking at the dog? Why did I choose to stare at the mouse? Do I feel safer knowing my dog will not betray me? Am I scared my dog might eat the mouse? Why do we choose who to
                            stare at when we choose?
                            <br><br>
                            So many questions I will never be able to answer as the room cools off for the first time in hours. The mouse slips back into his hole, choosing to lose this battle with dignity. As I look back at my dog, he is already
                            fast asleep, my glass eye still soaked in sweat.

                            People ask me how I'm doing when I pass them by on the street and I find it bizarre. Why ask a question you don’t want an answer to? It’s a useless way to use up words that are such a commodity in this life. Get this, we
                            actually have names for everything around us. We can talk to each other without needing to be physically present in the same space. If I am stuck in a hole somewhere, I have the vocabulary to explain where I am and how I
                            got there, so they can find me while tracking the woods.
                            <br><br>
                            So, the way I got here is an interesting story.
                            <br><br>
                            Yesterday I decided to take a stroll down memory lane that just so happens to be inside of these woods. The lane has yet to be reached as I seem to have taken a bit of a detour into what seems to be a pile of quicksand
                            inside a rather large hole. No one tells you how extremely uncomfortable quicksand is when it slips inside your clothes. In this particular situation, I have to admit that having male parts is a total advantage.
                            <br><br>
                            My breathing is also starting to get compromised. Those meditation classes in college are really paying off here. I've been able to stay alive for the last 5 hours by not panicking myself to death. If you haven’t tried
                            meditation, I seriously recommend it.
                            <br><br>

                            They approached the woods as the sun hid behind the clouds, one single droplet of rain falling to its demise as the wind blew it in the wrong direction.
                            <br><br>
                            “Stop. This doesn’t feel right. I think we should turn around.”
                            <br><br>
                            The girl looked at her boyfriend and laughed an unpleasant sort of sound that she knew made him uncomfortable.
                            <br><br>
                            “You want me to turn around after all the shit we've had to go through to get here? You can’t be serious. Take this and help me.”
                            <br><br>
                            He looked at the rope hanging by her bloody fingertips and sighed before taking it from her. The rain should have fallen by now, but all he felt was the roaring wind on his skin telling him to run. He took the rope and
                            tied it around his neck.
                            <br><br>
                            “Now what?” he said.
                            <br><br>
                            “Now you start walking. Let’s go. It’s not far from here.”
                            <br><br>
                            They walked a few more miles until reaching a cliff. The purple waterfall falling against the orange rocks was a sight so mesmerizing they stopped to stare for a long while. The sun came back out from behind the clouds,
                            warming up their bloody bodies as a sign of peace.
                            <br><br>
                            “You still want to do this?” he asked.
                            <br><br>
                            “Yes.”
                            <br><br>
                            The weather suddenly turned cold as the snow started to fall. Leaves on the trees froze over and the waterfall dried off instantaneously, completely vanishing from existence. In a matter of seconds, this world stood still
                            as Alice and Cam took their last watery breath at the bottom of the ocean.

                            I am currently stuck in the center of the universe. If you want to know what that means, so do I. Both everything and nothing happens here, and no, I am not a God.
                            <br><br>
                            Yesterday I had a sip of coffee before the tremors started and I had to sit down to think. Doctors told me I have a few more months of normalcy before things start getting bad, but it seems to be progressing faster than
                            expected. I'm not exactly scared, but I’m definitely angry.
                            <br><br>
                            My days are not fun anymore. It takes me twice as much time to get from point A to point B. I remember most of my life, but forget the simple day to day stuff. My tolerance for pointless conversations has not only
                            diminished, but completely evaporated, and my patience in time has grown.
                            <br><br>
                            When I was younger, I had an affinity for bad movies. I would sit through them laughing my way to tears, only to realize the time, effort, and money spent to produce such shit. Then I would drink myself into oblivion and
                            repeat the process the next day.
                            <br><br>
                            I would occasionally take walks to the park that sat beside my house, but hated the yelling children that often bounced on the trampoline. If the swings were empty, I'd occupy them by sitting still and staring at the sky,
                            just to mess with them, teaching them important life lessons that privilege has to be earned.
                            <br><br>
                            My siblings all died young, with my parents, in a car accident. I was the youngest and don’t remember them. Hardly a trauma. I was then raised by my mother’s sister, who was a very nice woman. She never did much with her
                            life, but never screwed it up either, so I think she died peacefully bland.
                            <br><br>
                            My career took away any remaining shred of childhood innocence I had left, and I spent the next 50 years working the same job. Now I am old and dying, or possibly already dead.
                            <br><br>
                            My life was a boring fuck of a disaster, but it was mine and so, I remember it with love.

                            The couch sinks into me sometimes while I watch TV. Mostly during my favorite shows, but there are times when I lack the appropriate amount of sleep and it sinks right back into my arms. I think it might be in love with
                            me.
                            <br><br>
                            For the longest time I tried to understand the feeling, only to realize I wasn’t going crazy. That hurts a little, because I have no one on my side to believe me. So, now that most of my friends have left me, I talk to my
                            couch, and I think I love it too.
                            <br><br>
                            There are no explanations for crazy stories. I have learned to be ok with the concept of acceptance, but its practicality has never resonated. Now most people just call me sad. They aren’t wrong. Most days it takes all of
                            my energy to part from my couch, only to end up under my covers hiding from the world.
                            <br><br>
                            We aren’t all made equally. Some of us were shipped to earth missing a few crucial parts, and now that I am out of meds all I do is cry and hope my couch will continue loving the messy existence I am.

                            up until now, and he was just 27 years old.

                            He walked in tall. The laces on his grey shoes were bright pink, a neon color you could only find at a rave party. White pants followed shortly after the little gap of skin between his shoes and flamingo socks. A comedian.
                            On his pockets, splotches of paint, but not enough to assume the profession. One hand tucked inside his jacket marked a quiet cool, while his other hand reached out to shake the man's who welcomed him. He had no ring on
                            his finger, assumed single, and three wooden bracelets that hung off his hand indicating an appreciation for chic. His jacket was a distant blue color, sharing its space with colorless geometrical shapes, a clash between
                            the straight edge and the obscure. Underneath the jacket a shirt. Simple, chaotic, yet colorful enough it caught the laziest of eyes. True surrealism in a frame of a painting, fresh enough it still dripped on the wooden
                            floor of the gallery. He smiled, his front teeth overlapping just enough to give out a bad-boy vibe, his full lips embracing them with pride.

                            He turned around to observe the room. His eyes were dark and tempestuous as the center of a sunflower, bright enough they bloomed under the red chandelier above him. Turning back to take off his jacket he finally revealed
                            his muscular arms, but he was no athlete. A single profession could not describe him, but he would burn himself into the minds of a crowd, like cows herded by a legless shepherd. His hair was thick, dark and styled. He
                            looked approachable, a breath of fresh air among the pile of worthless dust accumulating in corners, holding their drinks, and laughing with people they would forget, regretting that last drink of the night.

                            before curving his hand into a fist and knocking on the door. No answer. He tried again. Finally, from a distance, footsteps were heard approaching the door. They sounded sharp yet gentle, a woman in heels.

                            Slowly, the door started to open. In front of him stood a tall, slim, well dressed woman in her 30s. Her hair was long and blonde, her eyes the color of a good Merlot, wearing a tight and short yellow dress. She looked
                            stern and confused by his presence.
                            <br><br>
                            “Yes?”
                            <br><br>
                            “I, I am sorry to bother you ma’am. Catharine told me you might be able to help me.”
                            <br><br>
                            “With?”
                            <br><br>
                            “My back. It’s killing me.”
                            <br><br>
                            She rolled her eyes and waived him in with her long skinny hand. As he started to enter, the wooden steps caved in and tore into his leg. He pushed himself back up, bleeding heavily. The woman continued staring at him in
                            confusion. After a few seconds, she started walking into the house.
                            <br><br>
                            “Come inside. We’ll fix it.”
                            <br><br>
                            He limped into the living room and sat on the couch. It smelled old and stale, the fabric ripped off in places. The wood on the floor was heavily damaged, and the paint on the walls cracked. To his left was a coffee table
                            that seemed out of place and to his right, a painting of a man that could be presumed the woman’s husband.
                            <br><br>
                            “Thank you.” she said.
                            <br><br>
                            “Excuse me?”
                            <br><br>
                            “Thank you for coming in. Let me get the bandages.”
                            <br><br>
                            She walked away and left him on the couch, bleeding onto her floor. He took off his jacket to try and slow down the bleeding with no success. A few seconds later she returned with some rubbing alcohol and bandages. She
                            placed them on the couch next to him, went down on her knees, and ripped the bottom of his jeans.
                            <br><br>
                            “Thank you.” She said.
                            <br><br>
                            “Excuse me?”
                            <br><br>
                            “For waiting. I must have misplaced the alcohol.”
                            <br><br>
                            She took the bottle off the couch, unscrewed the cap and poured it all on his wound. The alcohol stung, his teeth clutched together as he held back the tears. His blood mixed itself with the alcohol, flooding the floor
                            around them. Then, she took the bandages and tightly wrapped them around the wound.
                            <br><br>
                            “There, all done.” She said.
                            <br><br>
                            “Please, let me help you clean the floor. I feel awful about all of this.”
                            <br><br>
                            “Don’t worry. It will slip through the cracks right down to the basement where the rats live. They’ll have a party tonight.”
                            <br><br>
                            He wasn’t sure if it was a joke or if she was serious. Studying her face, the only thing he gathered was that she had an extraordinary beauty.
                            <br><br>
                            “Tell me about your back.”
                            <br><br>
                            Her statement snapped him back into the room.
                            <br><br>
                            “I, I have scoliosis. I fell off our ladder picking the olive tree. Haven’t been able to go a day without pain since.”
                            <br><br>
                            “When did it happen?”
                            <br><br>
                            “About a week ago.”
                            <br><br>
                            She continued to stare at him. Her eyes seemed to change color.
                            <br><br>
                            “Yes.” She said.
                            <br><br>
                            “What?”
                            <br><br>
                            “Yes, I think I can help you. Take off your shirt.”
                            <br><br>
                            Confused but willing to oblige he stood up in pain and took off his shirt. She took it from his hands and put it on the misplaced coffee table. Her hands met his shoulders, gesturing him to sit back down.
                            <br><br>
                            “Where exactly does it hurt?”
                            <br><br>
                            “The center.”
                            <br><br>
                            She came closer, putting one leg over him, sitting down on his knees facing him. Her hands slowly wrapped around his naked back, her fingernails penetrating his skin while her lips met his neck. Confused, his back
                            stiffened, and his heartbeat started to rise. She slowly lifted her head, looked him in the eyes and smiled. Her legs spread further apart as her body got closer to his. In that moment, she had him locked like a statue
                            pulling her hands towards her and snapping his back into place. She stood up and walked towards the kitchen.
                            <br><br>
                            “Tell Catharine I say hello. She was a dear friend.”
                            <br><br>
                            He stood up and found his shirt and jacket. Unsure how to feel, he got dressed and thanked the woman for her help. His pain was gone, but he felt oddly abused non the less. He liked but feared her. As he started walking
                            toward the door, he caught another glimpse of the painting on the wall. It changed. Staring back at him was a face much too familiar. A face he woke up to every morning. A face he wanted to betray with the woman standing
                            behind him. Catharine.

                            Chills ran down my back almost as if to signal me a warning. I came here for a reason, and this time, I wasn’t going to leave without her. The blue lace starting at the fingertips, intertwined at her middle finger, a fuck
                            you to my bank account. I could afford her this time, and she would soon be mine.
                            <br><br>
                            She was the silent type. Long and curly, but with substance. There was a story to her I ached to know, and as those sweet seconds passed by while I stood there and stared, my lips salivated like a dog’s before dinner. I
                            wanted her, and only her.
                            <br><br>
                            The air around me felt stale, suffocating my mind from thinking clearly. I wished there was a window I could open to air out the room, but I was afraid to leave her sight. If she ended up with someone else, my heart would
                            be forever broken, and my ego would follow.
                            <br><br>
                            My thoughts continued to talk to me as I stood there admiring her elegance. A man passed by me, nudging me ever so slightly with his shoulder as if to make sure I knew he existed. I didn’t care for him. Another man passed
                            by me a few minutes later, also nudging me with his shoulder. I didn’t care for him either. When the third man came along nudging me with his shoulder, I started sensing a pattern. A fourth would follow. Somebody was
                            trying to move me from my position in the most uncomfortable way. I didn’t care.
                            <br><br>
                            My credit card was safe at home in my dresser. Today was a day where I paid cash, in full. The air was getting dryer, my thoughts getting quieter as the room got louder. I couldn’t look away from her. She was my prize and
                            I was winning tonight. No one could distract me from what I wanted.
                            <br><br>
                            Another nudge shifted me from my position. Then another one. Three more followed. I still didn’t care. Too distracted by her beauty, I started stripping her. She was everything. By now, I've waited too long to undress her
                            from the plastic shell of the human she hung of. Her color was sky blue, peaceful, yet daring. Handmade, she was one of a kind, with lace and silk working together as one. The pearls on the collar were a necessary touch,
                            and she sparkled vibrantly, almost unrealistically. A tint of yellow and orange mixed themselves with the blue, details I missed while mesmerized by her.
                            <br><br>
                            Suddenly from the corner of my eye I saw something. I felt as if someone was watching me undress her, and I felt uncomfortably hot. I cared this time, a protective instinct flushed over me like a mother wolf taking care of
                            her young. No one was taking her from me today, and for the first time, I looked up since entering the room. It was on fire.
                            <br><br>
                            I turned back to her, this time not taking my time. I tore the rest of her off without damaging a single stitch. It was getting hotter and the sweat on my forehead met my eyes. People were running passed me, trying to find
                            their way to the exit. I needed to cash out, throwing my money towards a direction that seemed most likely to take it. She was hard earned and the flames weren’t going to stop me from paying my dues. I ran for the door but
                            tripped and fell, a hand reaching out for mine to help me stand back up. He was a handsome, tall, dark fella.
                            <br><br>
                            “You need to move! This building won’t last long. Please, let me carry you out.”
                            <br><br>
                            Suddenly I felt lifted from the ground, the room foggy from the smoke, my thoughts a high pitched buzz. I started to cough, my hands wrapped around his neck feeling the turbulence as we ran to safety. We made it out of the
                            building just in time before it collapsed into a pile of burned brick. He let go of me and placed me back on my feet, the fresh air a refreshing smell. He really was very handsome, but I had no time for him. I thanked him
                            for saving my life and rushed to tend to her. She meant more to me than him, been in my thoughts longer, I dreamt about her often. I wanted to enjoy her in all her beauty, and celebrate our new journey together. Finally, I
                            had her, after all this time. I brought my hands up to smell her, feel her on my skin, see her in sunlight, but my hands were empty and grey. I still remember hearing my heart crack as I realized she was burnt into ashes
                            under the charred mausoleum of a building, still whispering my name.

                            He was making out with him. I was his girlfriend. It was very confusing, and it was New Year’s. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. He was nowhere to be found. I searched for a while and found him in the embrace of another man giving away what
                            was supposed to be my first kiss of the year. Betrayed, I let them continue their fun, pretending as though their act just ricocheted off me. The snow outside melted before it hit the ground, the pasta boiling on the stove
                            was 20 minutes overcooked, and a few of my friends were passed out on the floor after playing King's cup. The clock continued ticking, it was suddenly 5am. Where was he again? He wasn’t in bed, he wasn’t by the pool, or in
                            any of the bathrooms. Searching through time and space for what seemed like an endless adventure, I finally found him in the corner room of the house. With him. They were sitting next to the old Windows 98 computer, the
                            light off the screen reflecting onto their lying faces.
                            <br><br>
                            “We need to talk about this.” I said.
                            <br><br>
                            “Who are you? “said the other kid.
                            <br><br>
                            “I'm his girlfriend “
                            <br><br>
                            His face flushed with an apple shade of red, and I understood in that moment the information he just learned was new to him. The boyfriend wasn’t telling him the whole truth. My first instinct was to feel sorry for the
                            kid, but after a few seconds I just felt close to him. I knew we would be great friends. I liked him. Panicking, the kid took my hand and sat me on his lap across the betrayer.
                            <br><br>
                            “I'm so sorry. I had no idea. “said the kid.
                            <br><br>
                            “I caught that. “
                            <br><br>
                            “Please know, I would never do anything like that if I knew! “
                            <br><br>
                            “My beef is with him honey, not you. “
                            <br><br>
                            “I don’t know what to do! How can I fix this? I'd like to fix this! “
                            <br><br>
                            I was going to respond with a cool but cold “Don't worry about it”, but as I started getting it out the kid wrapped his fingers around my hair, pulled me toward him, and kissed me. There was tongue, it was long, and it was
                            good. What the hell was happening? I let it go on for too long, so I pulled away and stood up in a hurry.
                            <br><br>
                            “What the fuck? “I asked.
                            <br><br>
                            “I'm sorry! I panicked! “
                            <br><br>
                            “So, you decided to kiss me? “
                            <br><br>
                            “I didn’t know what to do. “
                            <br><br>
                            “He is a good kisser isn’t he? “the boyfriend chipped in.
                            <br><br>
                            All of a sudden, I was pulled in by both of them, with nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. I liked it. Challenges intrigue me. My boyfriend’s lips finally met mine for the first time that night.
